# Self-Stabilizing Spoon for Parkinson's Sufferers

## Project Overview
This project is a self-stabilizing spoon designed to help individuals with Parkinson's disease by minimizing hand tremors. It uses an Arduino Uno, MPU6050 gyroscope, and servomotors to stabilize the spoon.

## Features
- Real-time tremor detection and stabilization.
- Uses MPU6050 for motion sensing.
- Adjustable sensitivity for tremor correction.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- MPU6050 Gyroscope and Accelerometer  
- Servomotors (SG90)  
- Power supply (9V battery or adapter)  
- Connecting wires and breadboard

3. **Testing:**
   - Power the setup and test the spoonâ€™s stability by simulating tremors.


## Future Scope
- Improve the stabilization accuracy by fine-tuning PID values.  
- Reduce power consumption.  
- Implement Bluetooth control for remote adjustments.
