# Self-Stabilizing Spoon for Parkinson's Sufferers

## Project Overview
This project is a self-stabilizing spoon designed to help individuals with Parkinson's disease by minimizing hand tremors. It uses an Arduino Uno, MPU6050 gyroscope, and servomotors to stabilize the spoon.

## Features
- Real-time tremor detection and stabilization.
- Uses MPU6050 for motion sensing.
- Adjustable sensitivity for tremor correction.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- MPU6050 Gyroscope and Accelerometer  
- Servomotors (SG90)  
- Power supply (9V battery or adapter)  
- Connecting wires and breadboard

## How to Run the Project
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the MPU6050 and servomotors to the Arduino.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
2. **Simulation:**
   - Open the simulation on Wokwi:  
   [Wokwi Simulation Link](https://wokwi.com/)  
3. **Testing:**
   - Power the setup and test the spoonâ€™s stability by simulating tremors.
